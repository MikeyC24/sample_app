	this tests fails on the assert redirect to but not sure why, it works on local server
	although maybe it shouldnt since no ajax was added yet
	test "should end on user page after follow" do
		assert_not @user.following?(@other_user)
    	@user.follow(@other_user)
    	assert @user.following?(@other_user)
